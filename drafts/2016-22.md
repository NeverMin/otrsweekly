# Blogposts

## TicketTyp mit Dynamischen Feld und GenericAgent setzen (German)

I wrote a blogpost how you can change the ticket type in the "reply" dialog without changing code, but using dynamic fields and
the GenericAgent.

# Interesting Otterhub threads

## Are there any rule when to use development customization, ACL, Generic Agent, Process Manager, customizing module ...

@OTRSRDNewbie wants to know when I should use the built-in features and when to customize the code.

## Agent access report or SQL extract

@JeremyB3ntham needs help to create a report about the permissions that the agents have. @Crythias gives some hints
for the SQL query that is needed to get the information.

# Addon updates

## New OPAR addons

### TicketACLCustomerCompany

This was created to allow ACLs based on Customer Company ID. This is useful when you have 
support for multiple customer ids activated.

See [TicketACLCustomerCompany on OPAR](http://opar.perl-services.de/dist/TicketACLCustomerCompany)

### TicketZoomDynamicFieldDisplay

If you want to show more of the (very long) value of dynamic fields in ticket zoom, you could use the SysConfig option
Ticket::Frontend::DynamicFieldsZoomMaxSizeSidebar, but if you want the complete value of a single dynamic field, you
can use TicketZoomDynamicFieldDisplay

See [TicketZoomDynamicFieldDisplay on OPAR](http://opar.perl-services.de/dist/TicketZoomDynamicFieldDisplay)

### DynamicFieldOTRSAgents

This addon allows you to define DynamicFields that lists all (valid) OTRS agents in the dropdown. Currently this
addon supports only single selects.

See [DynamicFieldOTRSAgents on OPAR](http://opar.perl-services.de/dist/DynamicFieldOTRSAgents)
