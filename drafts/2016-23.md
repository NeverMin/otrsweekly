## New OPAR addons

### TicketDynamicFieldsDebugDialog

When you develop a new feature and that involves dynamic fields, you can enable all dynamic fields for AgentTicketZoom to see the values.
But that is too much just to debug some stuff. Therefor this addon exists. You get a new ticket menu item where you get a dialog that
shows you all the dynamic fields and their values...

See [TicketDynamicFieldsDebugDialog on OPAR](http://opar.perl-services.de/dist/TicketDynamicFieldsDebugDialog)
