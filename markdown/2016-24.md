# Interesting Otterhub threads

## Plenty "No such file:" in log for FAQ module

@pvanos sees a lot of "No such file: " errors in his/her logs. Solution: Sometimes is reboot a valid option

See: [Thread on Otterhub](http://forums.otterhub.org/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=32557)

## CMDB overview empty

@soos' CMDB overviews are empty. As it turns out he/she had some custom deployment states that weren't
properly set in the preferences for the CI. So the CIs weren't in productive or post-productiv state.

## new phone ticket: dynamic field depending on customer user attribute

@pebeITS wants to show some dynamic fields based on a customer users' attribute. And the value for these
dynamic fields depend on the customer id as well. So this seems to need some development.

## Besitzer Neues E-Mail Ticket (German)

@MBork wants to assign all new email ticket created via webinterface to Admin OTRS (when no specific agent
was selected). This is not that simple to achieve...

## Probleme mit Mailfunktion (German)

@mainzel86 had some trouble when sending the auto response. He/She found the solution: Set the config option
SendmailNotificationEnvelopeFrom properly.

## Dynamisches Feld bei Ticketerstellung für eine bestimmte Queue automatisch befüllen (German)

@patzig tries to fill a dynamic field with a specific value when the ticket is created in a specific queue.
He can use the GenericAgent for that.
